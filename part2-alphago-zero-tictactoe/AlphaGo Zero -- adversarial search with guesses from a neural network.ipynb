The package not only implements the algorithm for Go, but also for the game of [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) which is a **generalization of Tic-tac-toe** played on the Go board. The program allows you to tweak the size of the board and the number of squares that need to be taken up consequitively to win the game. Hence Tic Tac Toe is a special case of Gomoku when the board is of size 3x3 and you need 3 colinear squares to win.\n",

    "\n",
    "- 48x48 convolutional layers that are 6 levels deep, trained on 10000 games, but we ended up sampling 6200 initial games that we used as prior for our mote-carlo sampling. Most games were run without training, but the neural network quickly learned the optimal strategy once training began\n",

So our training did not start to learn anything until it played about 6000 games, but was sampling games to assign priors for the monte carlo tree search. However, once the training started the priors accumulated from the 6000 games were enough to quickly learn the optimal strategy. The plot below shows this.\n",

    "However for the purpose of the examples here we went with the much lesser trained network of a setup where we only use 81 initial games to set the prior for the monte-carlo sampling. Also we only trained on 500 games and captured a snaptshot of the agent more frequently. This makes for a much more human-accessible example. You can actually play against the agent and see how dumb it started out and how it learned specific moves.\n",

    "Here is Donald Knuth talking about solving the game of tic tac toe by training against an optimal player https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_c3dKYrjj2Q . The idea of learning from self-play in AlphaGo are certainly not new, but the cleverness is in the monte carlo tree search. And of course the enormous amount of compute power required to train the network."
